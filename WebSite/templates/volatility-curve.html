    Volatility Curve

{% block main %}
The <a href="volatility-process">Volatility Process</a> give ways to calculate exotic option price calibrated to vanilla market which is observable and tradable in various exchange. However, even the vanilla option price are observable on exchange we still need a model to fit the volatility curve across different strike so our vanilla option price generated by our theoretical volatility is inline with the market. This provides us with some greate advantages:
<ul>
    <li>It allows us to use a limited number sets of parameters to explain the whole list of strikes of options so traders only have to manage a limited number sets of parameters other than more than hundres of strikes for a single expiry</li>
    <li>It allows us to provide our own views on options volatility since we are proactive in generating option theoretical price other than passively receiving prices from exchange</li>
    <li>Market price can be driven by lots of uncertainties (client flow, hedging activity, market news movement, random market activity). It shields us against these uncertainties by better understand these parameter movement w.r.t market price</li>
</ul>
Therefore, lots of parameterized volatility curve model has been proposed by academic or industry. There are lots of ways design a good volatility curve. A good volatility curve should be flexible enough to be able to capture the current market well and also able to prevent arbitrage on volatility surface.
